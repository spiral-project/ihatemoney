*I hate money* is a web application made to ease shared budget management.
It keeps track of who bought what, when, and for whom; and helps to settle the
bills.

* `Hosted version <https://ihatemoney.org>`_
* `Mailing list <https://mailman.alwaysdata.com/postorius/lists/info.ihatemoney.org/>`_

The code is distributed under a BSD *beerware* derivative: if you meet the
people in person and you want to pay them a craft beer, you are highly
encouraged to do so.
